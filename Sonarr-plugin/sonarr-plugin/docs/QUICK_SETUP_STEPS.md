# 🚀 Quick Setup Steps - Sonarr-Seedr Plugin

**Follow these simple steps to get your plugin running on Windows.**

## 🔄 How It Works

This plugin acts as a bridge between Sonarr and Seedr cloud storage. Here's how the folder system works:

- **Torrent Folder**: Sonarr stores `.torrent` files here → Plugin watches this folder → Uploads to Seedr cloud
- **Watch Folder**: Plugin downloads completed files here → Sonarr imports from this folder → Organizes your TV shows

**The key**: Both Sonarr and the plugin must use the EXACT SAME folder paths for everything to work automatically. When you drop a torrent file into the Torrent Folder, the entire process happens automatically: Sonarr → Plugin → Seedr → Plugin → Sonarr → Organized TV show!
